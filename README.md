This is a chess game I developed as a hobby coder

It is a complete working version of chess, including all the "special" moves like castling, promotion and en passant
I wrote the game following OOP principles and structured the code in a model-view-controller (MVP) design pattern

With all the failed attempts of how to realize this game it has taken multiple months to complete

This version now utilizes different data structures, inheritance, object instancing and other elements of the java language that I had to learn for this project
